## Third_man background
Third_man is a django/python based project whose aim is to provide an online webservice for small third_sector organisations based
on the generalisation that third sector organisations (e.g. churches, charities) prime operations center around organising events
and people, which is a clear demarkation from commercial organisations which revolve around producing and selling a goods
or service.

With this in mind, this aims to provide basic people and event management tools such as a calendar and messaging.
Further to this, it is hoped to integrete financial type functionality so that donations can be made, tickets sold and
basic merchandise (e.g. novelty mug or t-shirt) via online website. There will also be direct integration between the calendar
and the front end website (to be done with django content management system and react). The ideal is to be able to allow
organisations that use the tool scope to design their own website with ready made integrations from the data in the webservice
components.

The project utilises a python 3.7.4 virtual environment and the requirements.txt file provides a list of packages used.

The backend database is postgresql.
